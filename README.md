How do we improve reliability, visibility and speed?

1. Cypress Test (5 mins)

* Reliability: Cypress makes running and debugging tests easier

2. Visibility ( 5 mins)
* launch sorryc-cypress: launch director, launch dashboard, api via docker compose 
* run same tests and show dashboard outcomes

3. Speed (5 mins)
* rerun above tests with parallelization turned on
